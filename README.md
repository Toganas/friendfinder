# *Friend Finder*

### The app where you can find messed up friends!

The purpose of this app is to give you a 10 question survey and then match you with a random friend that best fits your answers by comparing them to their answers.

## Using the app

First thing you are asked to do is give your name and a link to a photo.

When using the app, you are given a statement and then a choice of selecting 1-5 how much you agree with the statement, 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree.

Once you click submit, the app will compare answers against other people that have answered the app.  The way it does this is comparing everything question by question.  So, if you answer a 3 on question 1 and someone else chose a 4, then you'll have a difference of 1.  After going through all the questions and comparing them, the app has a total difference from the sum of the differences it collects.

After checking against all other users in the array, it will give you a pop up of the user you match up with most closely.

## Made With?

This app was made with node.js, jquery, chosen.js, express, HTML, fontAwesome, and Bootstrap.  The live page is hosted on heroku.

## Plain Jane

This app took more out of me than I originally thought it would, so it's very boiler plate with little in the realm of styling or theme.  It's regrettable as I had hoped to have some fun with it and base it on some of the evil people in movies and video games.

## Question concept

As I wanted to at least have a little fun with it, I gave this app some questions that I thought were befitting an evil overlord.  This gives the app a little bit of flare and makes it a little more than just a friend finder.  I call it a messed up friend finder due to the fact that some of the questions/statements are a bit messed up and whomever you match with has got to have a bit of a screw loose somewhere.

## Final Statement

I hope you have fun playing with the app.  All coding is mine, but I had help from outside sources when I got stuck, such as looking at other people's products or videos.  I also got home from classmates/TA's while working on it.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the app more than I enjoyed making it.
